# Issue 12: Documentation and safety notes

## Background (reuse existing code)
- Extend `README.md` with usage docs without modifying existing sections heavily.

## Scope
- Add sections for each bot, config examples, CLI usage, and safety/compliance.

## Tasks
- Document environment variables required by `Polymarket` and Gamma.
- Add example commands for dry-run and live modes.
- Add safety notes: no self-trading/wash trading; adhere to venue TOS.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `README.md` updated with concise, copy-pasteable examples.
- Clear indication that defaults are `dry_run: true`.

## Notes
- Keep tone consistent with repo and avoid duplicating content.
